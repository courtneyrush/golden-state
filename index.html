                            Being an awesome coder requires having a still and balanced mind.
                            That's why we focus a lot on mindfulness practice and meditation.
                            Seems like an odd combo, but trust us it works!

                Thanks Golden State, you really helped me take a big step up in my career as a front end developer. I
                think what
                I learned most was about possibilities and options in life.
